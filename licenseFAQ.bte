<h2>Why is the GPL used?</h2>
Stephen chose to license the com.Ostermiller.util Java utilities under the GNU General Public License
because it encourages open source development by requiring that derivatives be licensed under
the same open source license.

<h2>Could it be licensed under something less restrictive?</h2>
Many people request they receive a copy of the utilities licensed under the Library General Public
License (LGPL) or a BSD style license.  The answer is firmly "no".  Those Licenses do not
ensure that derivative works remain liberated, and the libraries could then be used in closed source
applications.

<h2>How about a special one-time license just for this awesome project?</h2>
The com.Ostermiller.util utilities have many contributing authors.  Requesting the permission of all
those offers is not possible since they do not all believe that one-time licenses should be awarded
no matter how deserving the project.
