<h1>Comma Separated Values (CSV) in Java</h1>

<h2>Writing CSV files: CSVPrinter</h2>
<p>This class makes it easy to output CSV.  Given values, it will automatically determine if they need to be quoted and
escape special characters.  Comments can easily be written and correct line beginnings will be added.</p>

<p>Some applications do not accept CSV input according to the generally accepted standards.  One such application is the Microsoft Excel 
spreadsheet.  A separate class must be use to write 
<a href="http://ostermiller.org/utils/ExcelCSV.html">Excel CSV</a>.  Both CSVPrinter and ExcelCSVPrinter
implement the CSVPrint interface.</p>

<h2><a name="csv_parser">Reading CSV files: CSVParser</a></h2>

<p>Java's StringTokenizer does not make it easy to parse files of comma separated values for two reasons.
First StringTokenizer doesn't handle empty strings and second it doesn't have a way to easily get
Strings in quotes that have commas inside them.  This CSV parser takes care of those issues and
support line numbering, escape characters, and comments.  Each line of values can be returned as an array, or 
the values can be returned individually with the number of the line from which they came.</p>

<p>Some applications do not output CSV according to the generally accepted standards and this parse may
not be able to handle it.  One such application is the Microsoft Excel spreadsheet.  A 
separate class must be use to read 
<a href="http://ostermiller.org/utils/ExcelCSV.html">Excel CSV</a>.  Both CSVParser and ExcelCSVParser
implement the CSVParse interface.</p>

<h3>CSV Character Sets</h3>
<p>Several people have asked how to read CSV files that are in other character sets such as
Chinese or Japanese.  To parse such files, simple use the CSVParser constructor that takes a reader.
Make sure the reader has been initialized to read the correct character set.  An example that reads
Simplified Chinese (charset GB2312) CSV values from <a href="CSVCharsetTest.gb2312csv">CSVCharsetTest.gb2312csv</a>
can be found in <a href="CSVCharsetTest.java">CSVCharsetTest.java</a>.  If you have a Chinese font 
installed and Java is set up to use it, the example will show a dialog with each of the Chinese 
words on it.</p>

<h3>CSVLexer</h3>

<p>The lexer (CSVLexer) created using <a href="http://www.jflex.de/">JFlex</a> is still available in the download and is
still supported.  In fact,  CSVParser uses it behind the scenes.  However, CSVParser has a much cleaner, full-featured API
and its use is recommended.</p>

<p>A CSVLexer <a href="CSVRegressionTest.csv">regression test</a> and the expected
<a href="CSVRegressionTestResults.txt">results</a> of that test are available.</p>
