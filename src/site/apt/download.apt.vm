Download com.Ostermiller.util Java Utilities


The Ostermiller Java Utilities can be downloaded for various versions of Java and Kaffe below.

<div class="install"><h3>Installation</h3>
<p>The utilities are pre-compiled and ready to use. Simply use one of the following to
add the jar file to your classpath:

  * Put the jar file in the Java extensions directory.

  * Set your CLASSPATH environment variable to include the jar file.

  * Specify the jar file in the command line classpath when you compile and run your programs.

  * Extract the jar file to a folder already in your classpath.

  * Include the contents of the jar file in your program's jar file.

  * Reference the jar file from the manifest file in your program's jar file.


You can extract the contents of the jar file either with the jar tool that comes with Java or by 
renaming the jar file to have a .zip extension and using any zip file extractor.</p>
<p>If you have a Unix compatible system and you want to have easy access to the Base64, LineEnds, MD5Sum, RandPass, and Tabs
command line programs that come in these utilities, run this {{{install.sh}install shell script.}}</p>

<h3>Download Instructions</h3>

  * All downloads are in .jar format.  Some browsers think that jar is the same as zip.  If your browser renames the jar to have a .zip extension, please rename it back to .jar.

  * Be sure to download the version of the utilities that matches the version of Java that you are using. Otherwise you may get an UnsupportedClassVersionError exception.
