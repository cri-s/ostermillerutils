<p>Bas64 encoding and decoding of data.  Encode and decode methods for Strings, byte arrays, and streams.</p>

<p>Base64 is needed in many places other than its original use as an encoding format for transfering attachements in email.
It can be used anytime binary or arbitrary data needs to be represented in
common printable characters.  For example to connect to a web page that requires a username and password (basic authentication) you need to Base64 encode the username and password.  Here is a snippet to do so:<br>
<blockquote><code>
import com.Ostermiller.util.Base64;<br>
...<br>
URL url = new URL("http://....");<br>
HttpURLConnection connection = (HttpURLConnection)url.openConnection();<br>
connection.setRequestProperty("Authorization", "Basic " + Base64.encode(username + ":" + password));<br>        
InputStream in = connection.getInputStream();<br>
</code></blockquote></p>

<p>Be aware that Base64 encoding in <i>not</i> encryption.  Base64 scrambles the
output and it may appear to be unreadable, but it is easily readable by
anybody with a little experience or time.  Base64 encoded strings will often end
in one or two equal signs, and they will have only letters, numbers, plusses, and slashes.
Once somebody figures out that it is in Base64, it is just a matter of running
the decode method on it.  Furthermore, real encryption algorithms will change
the entire output if one bit in the input changes.  If you change a letter in a
your message and then re-encode it with Base64, only a few characters will
change.  Base64 is not a substitute for encryption.  Base64 used this way is
obfuscation, and rather poor obfuscation at that.  It may be a disservice to your
users to use Base64 as obfuscation because it may give them the impression that
their data is encrypted when it really isn't.</p>
